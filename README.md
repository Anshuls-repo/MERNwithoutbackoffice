## Server configuration

To install the latest AquilaCMS, you need a web server running node.js 12.19.0+ and mongoDB 4.2.5+.
The package manager yarn 1.22.4+ is required.

### System packages

You must verify that you have these packages installed on your OS :
g++ gcc libgcc libstdc++ linux-headers make python libtool automake autoconf nasm wkhtmltopdf vips vips-dev libjpeg-turbo libjpeg-turbo-dev

On Windows you must download wkhtmltopdf : https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html and libvips : https://github.com/libvips/libvips/releases (beware of 32 or 64 bits versions)

## Installation

You can download the source code from GitHub and run the following command-line (not 'Windows cmd') to launch the installer.

With npm :
```bash
yarn install
npm start
```

With pm2 :
```bash
yarn install
cp ecosystem.config.example.js ecosystem.config.js
npm run start:pm2
```

With docker :
```bash
docker pull aquilacms/aquilacms
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:3010:3010/tcp aquilacms/aquilacms
```

At the first launch, there is an installation page. It allows you to create an env.json file in the config folder.
You can edit this file manually, an example of the different possible properties is in the config/env.example.json file.

Warning : there is not MongoDB in AquilaCMS image. To connect your AquilaCMS website to a Mongo database, you can :
- run a MongoDB image next to the AquilaCMS image
- use an external link to, for example, an Atlas database
- use a localhost link to connect AquilaCMS to a database on your host machine (you have to edit your mongod.conf and change your bindIp by your network ip instead of 127.0.0.1)
